doing.\\nWe just went over the material last lecture.\\nIt's easier.\\nOkay, got them all, yes?\\nThe file is closing in five seconds.\\nYes, is there one more?\\nOkay, last call, yes?\\nOkay, very quickly we get the answer.\\nSo, one of the two HCI monikers,\\nthe first one being know thy user,\\nthe second HCI moniker is user is not like me.\\nRight, recognizing that people are different.\\nHow many people put user not like me?\\nOkay, with surveys.\\nIn an online survey, like SurveyMonkey,\\nyou're just calling up phone numbers.\\nYou generally learn.\\nYou know you can call thousands,\\nbecause you can blast a meme of a thousand people,\\nso hopefully people know that it's a thousands of people,\\nbut it would be weird to send a SurveyMonkey\\nto just two people you can send an email to.\\nAnd the answer here is that you learn a few things,\\nbut about a thousand people is the kind of score\\nthat you can assess A, okay?\\nContextual inquiry advocates which model?\\nAnd that is the master-apprentice model,\\nthe 100 master-apprentice model.\\nYou literally discovered this 48 hours ago.\\nGoing to a workplace to see how work unfolds\\nhelps you better understand what?\\nHow do people put the floor plan?\\nIt does.\\nI mean, that's not a wrong answer,\\nit's just not the best answer.\\nThe context?\\nYes, literally it's in the name.\\nSo it helps you better understand the context.\\nThe other ones are true.\\nYou learn about the floor plan,\\nyou understand better about the workplace equipment,\\nand you'll even learn something about the cafeteria,\\nbut that's not really the best answer.\\nThe best answer is to try to understand the whole context\\nwhich encompasses all those things.\\nOkay, when visiting the workplace,\\nthe probability of connection increases,\\nyou might consider taking back a view\\nand assume you have permission.\\nHow do people put photos?\\nYes, I think photos are acceptable.\\nNotes?\\nYes.\\nSketches?\\nYes.\\nAuto-recordings?\\nYes.\\nYou might consider, again,\\nwe talked about the pros and cons,\\nnone of them are perfect,\\nbut I think all those do.\\nAnd who puts furniture?\\nYes, generally you probably don't take the furniture\\nunless it's a very good reason.\\nOkay, and the purpose of,\\nthis is probably the hardest one here,\\nbut the purpose of rephrasing an answer\\nor detail to someone that you're studying,\\nthis is the rephrase and validate part\\nof when people are unsure,\\nand you're telling them your understanding of it,\\nand this is to understand,\\nso this is B, confirm your understanding.\\nYou rephrase it to them,\\nand they go, ah, that's mostly correct,\\nor yeah, that's correct.\\nThat's confirming your understanding.\\nThey already know their understanding,\\nso B is the best answer here.\\nHow many people put B?\\nOkay, okay, good, see, it picked up.\\nOkay, next thing I want to catch up on is the video prototype.\\nI had a chance, I think all the grades are posted already, but I wanted to pull out some\\nof the ones that I thought were kind of interesting and cool, and ones that were kind of ridiculous\\nand funny, and I was just going to show you four examples of what some of the other teams\\ndid.\\nThere was a lot of good ones, and actually, I think this is the best year in terms of\\ncoming up with good motivations.\\nI would say 95% of the teams had actually really good motivations, and I'm really thrilled\\nwith you.\\nI want to have a good story, a good setup, and no one just jumped right into their opening\\nshot.\\nThis is an interface, so I'm going to click through.\\nGood job on that, but let me just show you what some of the other teams did.\\nOh my gosh, keynote.\\nHere we go.\\nSong is leaving his house to get to class.\\nHe checks his calendar for any upcoming events.\\nOh no, an exam tomorrow, he needs a quiet place to study ASAP.\\nBut all the places Song knows about are so loud.\\nOh wait, he has the CMU app.\\nFinding a quiet place is a breeze with the CMU app.\\nHe first presses browser.\\nSo this was a still with a narrator and photoshop.\\nThen he's able to browse through all study areas and see their noise level.\\nGreat, a quiet place to study.\\nVery simple, very kind of simply done, but very effective.\\nIt doesn't have to be complicated.\\nVery good kind of example to be a first time.\\nHere's another one.\\nSo instead of filling out the document that Song left out, Song opens up the document.\\nHe makes a code, starts a code.\\nand she leaves it in the designated area, Gate 6.\\nJanice gets a notification on her smartwatch from Free Software\\nthat there's a new item offered.\\nA canvas tote bag that's just what she needs.\\nClicking into the notification, she sees more details of the item\\nand decides to claim it.\\nShe heads over to Gate and finds the bag in the area.\\nAgain, very, very simple setup.\\nSuper fussy, and it kind of gets to the interface really fast.\\nAnd you can pretty much understand the whole idea within 30 seconds.\\nNow the next video I'm going to show you,\\nand I don't mean to, like, super criticize,\\nbut it takes a long time to get to the actual point.\\nSo I'll play this one.\\nWe all live extremely busy lives, from being a student\\nto having a job hanging out with friends,\\nmeetings with professors, and et cetera.\\nThere are so many things going on in our lives\\nthat makes scheduling things between people quite difficult.\\nSo there's a bit of money this day we end up opening our eyes to.\\nWhere are they?\\nI'm waiting all day for them.\\nIt's very smartphone-centric.\\nI'll fast forward here.\\nSome interesting terms.\\nWe all live extremely busy lives.\\nYeah, okay, I'll be there in, like, two days.\\nOne of the students said that'll be enough time to get ahold of us.\\nOh, thanks!\\nYeah, actually, I was going to a meeting with some of my classmates, but I went to the wrong UC.\\nBut you said that.\\nThat's what I was thinking.\\nWell, we should reschedule, right?\\nReschedule.\\nI was, like, tracking the timings.\\nYou get the idea.\\nIt's interesting.\\nIt's pretty tongue-in-cheek.\\nAnd then here's one final one.\\nSo it's video as opposed to stills.\\nIt's paper instead of Photoshop.\\nVery fast narration just to get jumped right into the play.\\nSo I think this is a really cool idea, that it's basically, like, a socially driven music.\\nBut actually, based on what building you're in, you can basically listen collaboratively to what everyone else is listening to.\\nSo it's sort of like a cultural kind of, like, self-assembly.\\nBut it's kind of an interesting idea.\\nAnyway, I like this.\\none a lot and so I'm going to give them the built video prototype award where is\\nthis team? Raise your hand. Only one of you is here. Naughty. Well you'll have to give this to your teammates.\\nI expect you to wear them on campus today.\\nOkay, moving on. So what I want to resume on is actually do the second affinity\\ndiagram exercise that we didn't get to do. A bit more of a sort of a real scenario\\nnot just all the things that you touch in one given day. So this time of course\\nyour groups will be different so don't worry about that. I'll hand back out\\npost-it notes. So I have all the post-it notes still here. What I wanted to do is imagine like the\\nlike downtown district partnership is trying to come up with how do we get\\nlike more senior students to come downtown more often, okay? And this could\\nbe a real thing. They really do want senior students to come downtown more\\noften but there's various reasons why you probably do a lot less than you should.\\nSo what I wanted to do is again individually we're going to do this\\nindividually before meeting in your groups. I'll give you three to five\\nminutes just to get down as many ideas as you can.\\nWe have a lot of experts to consider as part of this panel.\\nJust put them in your neighborhood if you can.\\nSo again, good affinity diagramming practice is to try to boil it down to a single thought.\\nDon't just be like, weather, you know, that's too loose. B, it's too cold.\\nRain would be a different story, right? So try to make it as small and actionable as possible.\\nWho needs more positiveness?\\nAnd this is you personally. Don't try to extract what others are doing.\\nJust think about what you personally don't agree on.\\nಠಲಜಲರನಿಪತತಲನಿಕತನಮನಿ ಪಿಢನದರನಿರನಿರನವದರನ ಪಲಗತದನಾಜಲದದವದರನಿ ಪಢಲಾಕರಡಲನಿರನಿಭಏತಥದದದದ\\nಮಭಡಫಕಲಪಾಟನಿಠರಾಂಗಪಟಾರಲಾನಯಿರನದದರನಾಜಲದರನಾಗಧರನದದಗರ ಪಶಿಯಂಗರರನಗರರಲನಾಜಯಂಗರರಲದರನದ�\\nಇಪಡಿ ಸಬಗತಾನದರನವರನಾಜಲತಾಂ ಪರಬಹದರನಾಗತ\\nಇಪಡಿ ಸಬಗತಾನದರನಾಗತ\\nSee if you can do a better job of clustering it,\\nand again, we'll go around the room and see how,\\nthis is a more complicated problem\\nthan what you touch every day,\\nso there'll be different headings for different people.\\nSo roughly, eight people.\\nAnd again, if you have the same answer,\\nyou stack them, so if you have the same note,\\njust put them on top of each other.\\nOkay, and we're at 8,000 now.\\nOkay, so Esther's doing really good.\\nDo you have anything you wanna add, Esther?\\nOkay, cool.\\nHey, maybe one more minute to get your ideas up on the board.\\nOkay.\\nOkay, let's go around the room and we'll see if the teams that are still wrapping up can\\nwrap up.\\nOkay, let's hear what the different groups are doing.\\nIt's not vital that you get everything done.\\nLet's start.\\nTell us all of your categories from left to right.\\nWe have some problems here that we can see.\\nI'm nervous.\\nI don't have time to go in.\\nWhere were you?\\nYeah, we also have a lot of problems.\\nYeah, a lot of problems.\\nI didn't tell you whether there's going to be any issues.\\nNo.\\nIt's a very vital thing that we're going to have.\\nNot a good reason.\\nWhich is, you have, okay.\\nZoom.\\nOkay.\\nNext one.\\nAlright, so we have weather.\\nShould I just do it all?\\nYeah, just do it all.\\nI'll clarify.\\nOkay.\\nWeather.\\nSo we've got weather.\\nYeah.\\nLet's just get there.\\nInconvenience, schedule for safety, especially at night, cost of care, alternatives to going there, and activities that either don't have to be there over the past year.\\nPersonal problems, it's just not having a presence there.\\nYeah, it seems like a common theme.\\nOkay, got it.\\nNext team.\\nOkay.\\nI think, Sam, I think that I would like to support everyone on downtown and the fun things you can do there.\\nBut not important things to do is the number one thing.\\nYeah.\\nAs well as, like, distance, and then it comes from that.\\nLike, you have, you don't want to worry about planning for it.\\nThere's other things.\\nIt's available to you much closer.\\nAnd then the price, whether it's 60 cents a day.\\nOkay.\\nOkay.\\nSo definitely some common themes.\\nNext team.\\nYeah, we have some pretty similar stuff.\\nLike, not knowing what to do.\\nOne of our issues we have here today is we can't drink there.\\nWe don't drink wine.\\nWe weather CMUs, like, we're in a bubble that we're trapped in.\\nThe lagginess of the port authority sometimes.\\nYeah.\\nMy friend's stuff.\\nAnd we also have noise stuff.\\nWow, see, the two noise issue ones.\\nIt's not a good thing.\\nI've never heard that.\\nI've never thought about how to prove it.\\nNext.\\nYeah.\\nSo, yeah, there are two.\\nYeah.\\nWe work so hard for it.\\nThere's a lot of information about what you can have.\\nYou can have money.\\nSo there's a lot of devices you can have.\\nI think we have a lot of questions about the weather and the ships that we are going to\\nuse.\\nOkay.\\nNext team.\\nSo we have 20, that's a pretty powerful amount of money on this.\\nWe saw our parking, transportation, weather.\\nOkay.\\nOkay.\\nInteresting.\\nOkay.\\nFinally.\\nSo we have weather, transportation, lots of crowds, lack of activities, costs, safety,\\nand we also have cell reception.\\nYeah.\\nNow would that maybe go under safety?\\nLike do we already communicate?\\nOh yeah.\\nFriends?\\nI don't know.\\nThat's a little bit of an oddball one.\\nBut yeah.\\nOkay.\\nNext team.\\nSo we have a lot of questions about the weather and the ships that we are going to use.\\nOkay.\\nNext team.\\nSo we have weather, transportation, lack of activities, costs, safety, and we also have\\ncell reception.\\nOkay.\\nNext team.\\nSo we have weather, transportation, lack of activities, costs, safety, and we also have\\ncell reception.\\nOkay.\\nNext team.\\nclose it down early, the restaurants are empty by 8. You can't even get food after 8 there.\\nYeah, we can talk about that. I mean, if you like Walnut Street, then you'll fall in love\\nwith them.\\nBurn! Okay, sit back down. We're going to move on.\\nOkay, so just to wrap up a little bit on observation and niche finding, there's two sort of effects\\nthat I wanted to briefly mention that can sometimes impair your ability to get a good\\ncontextual view.\\nSo number one is this notion of expert blindness. How many people have heard the term expert\\nblindness before? It's a really important term. So basically this is this notion that\\nyou are so good at what you do that you basically can no longer see the pitfalls. This is sort\\nof like the Snapchat interface effect. You're so good at using it and you're so adept at\\nmobile applications that you can sort of figure it out. But that isn't expert blindness.\\nIf you think that's an easy interface to use, it's because you're suffering from expert\\nblindness. So it's very dangerous. Masters who you are trying to learn from will exhibit\\nexpert blindness. So they'll skip over. It's like, oh, I'm just going to spool this to\\nthe printer. And they'll push like 15 buttons really fast and you'll have no idea what happened.\\nAnd you may assume, oh, they just went to like file, print, and they hit return or something\\nlike that. But actually it might have been this really complicated system where they\\nhad to check some box and collate it and double-cite it. So you have to be very cognizant that\\nthe master is suffering from expert blindness.\\nAnd you yourself as like sort of an expert in HCI or UX or computer science, whatever\\nyour discipline may be, that you're going to suffer from it in sort of an opposite way.\\nSo this is sort of doubly important that when you're in these activities, that you go through\\nthe process.\\nDon't just let them demonstrate for you, because things that seem so trivial actually may actually\\nbe really complicated.\\nAnd if you do it yourself, you'll see, oh, hold on, I have to select this like other\\nweird printer, I have to print it in order to get it to like the claims department, just\\nsort of like virtual school box or some really esoteric thing.\\nYou'll discover that if you make them do it.\\nThat's one of the reasons why it's a master-apprentice model, that you're meant to learn, you're\\nmeant to do it.\\nYou're going to do it in a very poor, slow way, but it forces you to have to basically\\nkind of learn their job.\\nAgain, not just an interview.\\nYou want to have that kind of relationship.\\nSo tech deployments is a double.\\nSo here's this one example.\\nI pulled this out of an old Microsoft video.\\nThis is them testing what would become Windows 95, but back in 93.\\nAnd it's someone using a mouse for the first time.\\nAnd you might think, oh, that's a really intuitive thing.\\nBut it's actually pretty difficult.\\nSo let's watch this video.\\nAnd he's doing a think-aloud.\\nGo.\\nI'm using a double-click mouse.\\nI'm going to icon.\\nI'm coming down here.\\nI'm going to get there.\\nI'm going to be sure that it's on, though.\\nIt's on twice.\\nI'm going to click this.\\nI'm going to read down here.\\nLet me read it again to see if I did something wrong.\\nDouble-click.\\nOh, I'm using a double-click.\\nIt took me to the left twice.\\nI did that.\\nYeah, great.\\nYou did a good job.\\nYour mouse pointer is jumping between the clicks, so that's why it's not working.\\nOh.\\nBoy, that's too sensitive.\\nand over here.\\nPause it there.\\nOkay, so I'll just pause it there.\\nIs, you know, we take for granted\\nusing a trackpad and a mouse.\\nAnd this person's using it really for the first time.\\nAnd what they notice in that,\\nwhen they're testing this early,\\nwe're like a beta version of Windows 95,\\nis that we have, right now,\\nall of us have this mouse memory\\nwhere if we double click with the mouse,\\nwe know to keep it still.\\nBut for someone who hasn't really developed\\nthat sort of physical intuition,\\nhe was clicking, and in between the click,\\nhe was just nudging it.\\nYou know, the click was causing the mouse\\nto jump like one or two pixels,\\nyou know, a very small amount.\\nAnd in response, Windows was rejecting it as a double click.\\nIt's like clicks have to happen in the same spot.\\nIt seems like such a tiny thing,\\nbut this person actually couldn't do it.\\nI mean, the video, I'm sure, was longer,\\nand it was probably, he was encountering this problem\\nin many different spots in the interface.\\nSo again, it seems so obvious to us,\\nand we can pretty much walk up to any computer\\nwith a mouse to track that,\\nand we can use it immediately.\\nAnd that's because you have tens of thousands of hours\\nof practice on those things\\nthat you can basically walk up to like an airport kiosk\\nfor getting your ticket,\\nand you can use it immediately, right?\\nBecause you're so good at it.\\nAnd I'm sure you've been next to someone else online,\\nor like the automated checkout at like Giant Eagle,\\nand there's just someone who is just getting destroyed\\nby that interface,\\nand just cannot get to the finish line.\\nAnd you might be like, oh, they're dumb,\\nbut they're not, they're just inexperienced.\\nAnd you're an expert,\\nand you just don't realize that you're an expert.\\nHere's another interesting item.\\nSorry, this popped up so many times.\\nI'll turn off the light,\\nit's probably gonna be a popped page.\\nSo there's a really interesting\\nlittle kind of micro-study that they ran.\\nCan anyone, if you look closely at this,\\ncan you notice something unusual?\\nSo they gave this to radiologists, okay?\\nThey gave this to radiologists who are experts\\nat looking at these things,\\nand basically saying, oh, there's like a tumor here,\\nor there's like, I don't know, like a lung cavity,\\nand there's like, you know,\\nsome sort of like water in the lungs, or something like that.\\nAnd I think this is a cross-section of someone's lung.\\nAnd if you're in the front row,\\nsee what really where is it? What is that? It's a little gorilla inside someone's lungs.\\nAnd what they found, if you stand in the back row, it's very solid, like you can sort of\\nsee it. And they showed this to radiologists, like, do you notice anything wrong about this\\nhuman? It's a healthy human. So they're like, no, the CT scan looks fine. There's a freaking\\ngorilla in there, which is clearly not like fun. We think that's the most obvious thing\\nto talk about if you're an expert. But the fact that they're so tuned to pattern matching\\nfor actual medical things, that they're basically blind, cognitively blind, is something that\\nis very remarkable. So for example, expert blindness, novices sometimes can see things\\nmore clearly than even experts in some cases.\\nOkay, here's a totally different effect that some of you may be aware of. So if you know\\nthe answer to this, sort of mums the word, let other people sort of think it through.\\nBut it's another effect that comes up all the time when you're studying the context\\nand the contextual background of problems. So the original, kind of the classic study\\nof this actually goes back to the 40s, to World War II. And what they were looking at\\nis the military was trying to figure out where they could put extra armor. They had a certain\\npayload capacity on the design of bombers, and they could add on a certain amount of\\nextra armor. And what they did is they said, well, let's do this in a data-driven way.\\nRather than just like, yes, where we should put the armor, let's do this in a data-driven\\nway. And so when we look at lots of aircraft that are coming back from combat situations,\\nwe can look at, you know, where they're getting shot, right? And so for the military, look\\nat the bomber, the recurrence of enemy territory, and they recorded where those planes had taken\\nthe most damage. And over and over again, they saw the same pattern, right? That bullets\\ntended to accumulate, damage to the aircraft tended to accumulate along the wings, around\\nthe tail gunner, and down the center of the bomb. Okay, they saw this pattern, this is\\nwhere it's accumulating the most damage. So, taking this into account, where would you\\nput the armor if you were the military? Okay.\\nYeah, so back in the day, these big bombers had like little, kind of like little turrets.\\nSo if an enemy fighter was tailing the bomber, they'd have a way to shoot back at the person\\nthat was flying on.\\nSo he'd tail gun him in a little bubble at the back with his own machine gun.\\nAnd there was normally a roof underneath and even one in the front on the left of the bigger\\nbomb.\\nDoes anyone have a theory on this?\\nYes?\\nSet that aside for now.\\nLet's just say there's 300 pounds of free weight that we can just add armor onto.\\nYes?\\nYes, did everyone hear that?\\nSo, the answer is you put the armor where there are no bullet holes.\\nOkay?\\nIf you think about this, the planes that are returning, so I have a nice succinct quote\\nhere.\\nSo here's an example of, for example, an aircraft.\\nSo this is not the bomber.\\nSo you see, you're getting planes like this returning.\\nYou say, oh my gosh, look at the whole wing that's blown off this fighter, little tiny\\nfighter.\\nRight?\\nSo you may say, well, where should we make it stronger?\\nAnd you think, okay, so the first intuition is to put it on the wing, to strengthen up\\nthat part that fell off.\\nBut the fact is, if this plane lands back at the airfield, it shows you that you can\\nactually lose that part of the wing and still make it back.\\nIf you have planes coming where there's no holes, that are the ones where, because it's\\nmissing from your data set, it means those are the ones that got shot there and probably\\njust like exploded and they never came back.\\nSo the ones that are coming back with holes is where actually it shows you can be shot\\nand survive.\\nOkay?\\nIt's a little bit counterintuitive.\\nSo let me just say that more simply.\\nThe holes actually show where the plane is the strongest, because it can still make it\\nhome despite having damage.\\nOkay?\\nAnd so what you want to do is you want to put the armor everywhere you don't see holes,\\nbecause that's presumably, assume it's a random distribution of holes, essentially.\\nAnd so you put armor where you don't see holes.\\nyou see no damage because those are the ones that got shot and they come back. Does that\\nmake sense? How many people, does this make sense? Okay, good. So, the planes that weren't\\nthere are the ones that needed the extra protection, the holes, the sort of thing that you build\\nlocations in, these are the least additional ones. So this effect is called survivorship\\nbias. You have to realize that you see survivorship bias in all different things. Because of just\\nnatural selection, not just in military aircraft, but in processes and fashion and everything,\\nall you're seeing are the exemplars that survive. So, for example, not the bomb armor,\\nbut the notion that older buildings are more beautiful. Pittsburgh has an amazing collection\\nof turn of the century and Gilded Age skyscrapers. But it's actually not true, like all these\\nwonderful Victorians like in Shadyside and stuff. The fact is older buildings are not more beautiful,\\nquantitatively. We have kept, it happened to be that the ones that we decided to preserve\\nand we kept for like a hundred years happened to be the nice ones. That's why we kept them.\\nAll the really ugly old buildings, and there were many of them, we've torn them down because\\nthey just weren't worth keeping. Same with old cars. People were like, oh my gosh, like a Ford,\\nThunderbird, like cars back in the 60s were just so elegant and so beautiful and they're still\\ndriving. They have like a Jeep from the 50s, it's so reliable. But that's because you're not hearing\\nabout like all the cars that were so terrible that it's like trashed them, even in the 60s,\\nthey just tossed them out. And there's lots of ones like the Pinto that would just occasionally\\njust explode and kill people, like for no reason. None of those are still driving on the road,\\neven though it's a terrible design. So there's also the notion that they don't make stuff like\\nthey used to because someone has some really old tool that happened to be, you know, it's a\\ndishwasher that is still surviving and you bought in the 80s and it still was working. That's because\\nthat's an example of something that happened to survive. And you don't have exemplars in the\\nday. Here's some other ones and songs from the 80s. If you watch like Stranger Things,\\nit's always like hit songs. Wow, what an amazing musical era.\\nBecause again, if you watch any show or movie set in the 80s,\\nit's like the same collection of 50 really awesome songs\\nfrom the 80s, and they're not playing all the ranked number\\n100 song from May of 1982.\\nAnd if you've never heard of that song,\\nit's not got any kind of nostalgia for you.\\nIt's just been essentially lost in time.\\nAnd same, and I see this a lot.\\nI have a startup myself, and everyone\\nover here can have these crazy best practices.\\nBut you have to realize that startups,\\nlike the people that got super successful,\\nsort of the Mark Zuckerbergs, for every Mark Zuckerberg,\\nthere's probably a thousand other people\\nthat had exactly the same idea and failed in different ways.\\nIt wasn't just like, he happens to think that his one path\\nwas probably like anyone could have done it\\nif he just followed those steps.\\nBut there was actually things before Facebook,\\nlike Friendster, that were arguably better and run\\nby more adept businessmen, and failed.\\nSo you have to take everything with a little bit\\nof a grain of salt. So whenever you're observing people\\nand processes, and even just artifacts,\\nyou have to realize that this effect is happening\\nand magnifying certain things.\\nYep.\\nBut they survived for so long,\\npeople imagine being in a different company\\nthan them, no?\\nYes.\\nIt's correlated, and sometimes they survive\\njust in pure coincidence, like certain movies\\nor cult classics that have survived,\\nor a certain car that, for whatever reason,\\njust accidentally happened to be more stronger\\nthan some counterpart.\\nSo yes, there normally is a rationale,\\nand I'm sure, Dr. Burton, not to take on poor duck,\\nbut I'm sure he wasn't terrible at his job,\\nbut I do think that you could probably find other people\\nthat were better, and still lost out.\\nSo there's lots of examples, like better products\\nthat basically were a huge failure,\\nlike the Alcoa and Starbreeze era, right?\\nI think so.\\nLike, I understand what's more in terms of pain,\\nbecause like, oh yes, they survived,\\nbut you know that you have to defend them,\\nlike men in the home, that didn't.\\nRight.\\nBut some, like Dr. Burton's stuff,\\nI don't know what I would put somewhere in that.\\nOr like old cars, too.\\nLike, really, those cars are super great,\\nand people love them, and they're not super safe,\\nbut I may like them for a reason,\\nand other parts of the era, you know?\\nYeah, so.\\n\""

       "\"but you've considered it. Okay, 45 seconds. How many people have done it? Raise your hand if you've done it. Okay, 10 newtons. Okay, start passing them in. How many people thought this one was easier than the last one? Raise your hand. That's not what we're doing. We just went over the material last lecture. It's easier. Okay, got them all, yes? The file is closing in five seconds. Yes, is there one more? Okay, last call, yes? Okay, very quickly we get the answer. So, one of the two HCI monikers, the first one being know thy user, the second HCI moniker is user is not like me. Right, recognizing that people are different. How many people put user not like me? Okay, with surveys. In an online survey, like SurveyMonkey, you're just calling up phone numbers. You generally learn. You know you can call thousands, because you can blast a meme of a thousand people, so hopefully people know that it's a thousands of people, but it would be weird to send a SurveyMonkey to just two people you can send an email to. And the answer here is that you learn a few things, but about a thousand people is the kind of score that you can assess A, okay? Contextual inquiry advocates which model? And that is the master-apprentice model, the 100 master-apprentice model. You literally discovered this 48 hours ago. Going to a workplace to see how work unfolds helps you better understand what? How do people put the floor plan? It does. I mean, that's not a wrong answer, it's just not the best answer. The context? Yes, literally it's in the name. So it helps you better understand the context. The other ones are true. You learn about the floor plan, you understand better about the workplace equipment, and you'll even learn something about the cafeteria, but that's not really the best answer. The best answer is to try to understand the whole context which encompasses all those things. Okay, when visiting the workplace, the probability of connection increases, you might consider taking back a view and assume you have permission. How do people put photos? Yes, I think photos are acceptable. Notes? Yes. Sketches? Yes. Auto-recordings? Yes. You might consider, again, we talked about the pros and cons, none of them are perfect, but I think all those do. And who puts furniture? Yes, generally you probably don't take the furniture unless it's a very good reason. Okay, and the purpose of, this is probably the hardest one here, but the purpose of rephrasing an answer or detail to someone that you're studying, this is the rephrase and validate part of when people are unsure, and you're telling them your understanding of it, and this is to understand, so this is B, confirm your understanding. You rephrase it to them, and they go, ah, that's mostly correct, or yeah, that's correct. That's confirming your understanding. They already know their understanding, so B is the best answer here. How many people put B? Okay, okay, good, see, it picked up. Okay, next thing I want to catch up on is the video prototype. I had a chance, I think all the grades are posted already, but I wanted to pull out some of the ones that I thought were kind of interesting and cool, and ones that were kind of ridiculous and funny, and I was just going to show you four examples of what some of the other teams did. There was a lot of good ones, and actually, I think this is the best year in terms of coming up with good motivations. I would say 95% of the teams had actually really good motivations, and I'm really thrilled with you. I want to have a good story, a good setup, and no one just jumped right into their opening shot. This is an interface, so I'm going to click through. Good job on that, but let me just show you what some of the other teams did. Oh my gosh, keynote. Here we go. Song is leaving his house to get to class. He checks his calendar for any upcoming events. Oh no, an exam tomorrow, he needs a quiet place to study ASAP. But all the places Song knows about are so loud. Oh wait, he has the CMU app. Finding a quiet place is a breeze with the CMU app. He first presses browser. So this was a still with a narrator and photoshop. Then he's able to browse through all study areas and see their noise level. Great, a quiet place to study. Very simple, very kind of simply done, but very effective. It doesn't have to be complicated. Very good kind of example to be a first time. Here's another one. So instead of filling out the document that Song left out, Song opens up the document. He makes a code, starts a code. and she leaves it in the designated area, Gate 6. Janice gets a notification on her smartwatch from Free Software that there's a new item offered. A canvas tote bag that's just what she needs. Clicking into the notification, she sees more details of the item and decides to claim it. She heads over to Gate and finds the bag in the area. Again, very, very simple setup. Super fussy, and it kind of gets to the interface really fast. And you can pretty much understand the whole idea within 30 seconds. Now the next video I'm going to show you, and I don't mean to, like, super criticize, but it takes a long time to get to the actual point. So I'll play this one. We all live extremely busy lives, from being a student to having a job hanging out with friends, meetings with professors, and et cetera. There are so many things going on in our lives that makes scheduling things between people quite difficult. So there's a bit of money this day we end up opening our eyes to. Where are they? I'm waiting all day for them. It's very smartphone-centric. I'll fast forward here. Some interesting terms. We all live extremely busy lives. Yeah, okay, I'll be there in, like, two days. One of the students said that'll be enough time to get ahold of us. Oh, thanks! Yeah, actually, I was going to a meeting with some of my classmates, but I went to the wrong UC. But you said that. That's what I was thinking. Well, we should reschedule, right? Reschedule. I was, like, tracking the timings. You get the idea. It's interesting. It's pretty tongue-in-cheek. And then here's one final one. So it's video as opposed to stills. It's paper instead of Photoshop. Very fast narration just to get jumped right into the play. So I think this is a really cool idea, that it's basically, like, a socially driven music. But actually, based on what building you're in, you can basically listen collaboratively to what everyone else is listening to. So it's sort of like a cultural kind of, like, self-assembly. But it's kind of an interesting idea. Anyway, I like this. one a lot and so I'm going to give them the built video prototype award where is this team? Raise your hand. Only one of you is here. Naughty. Well you'll have to give this to your teammates. I expect you to wear them on campus today. Okay, moving on. So what I want to resume on is actually do the second affinity diagram exercise that we didn't get to do. A bit more of a sort of a real scenario not just all the things that you touch in one given day. So this time of course your groups will be different so don't worry about that. I'll hand back out post-it notes. So I have all the post-it notes still here. What I wanted to do is imagine like the like downtown district partnership is trying to come up with how do we get like more senior students to come downtown more often, okay? And this could be a real thing. They really do want senior students to come downtown more often but there's various reasons why you probably do a lot less than you should. So what I wanted to do is again individually we're going to do this individually before meeting in your groups. I'll give you three to five minutes just to get down as many ideas as you can. We have a lot of experts to consider as part of this panel. Just put them in your neighborhood if you can. So again, good affinity diagramming practice is to try to boil it down to a single thought. Don't just be like, weather, you know, that's too loose. B, it's too cold. Rain would be a different story, right? So try to make it as small and actionable as possible. Who needs more positiveness? And this is you personally. Don't try to extract what others are doing. Just think about what you personally don't agree on. ಠಲಜಲರನಿಪತತಲನಿಕತನಮನಿ ಪಿಢನದರನಿರನಿರನವದರನ ಪಲಗತದನಾಜಲದದವದರನಿ ಪಢಲಾಕರಡಲನಿರನಿಭಏತಥದದದದ ಮಭಡಫಕಲಪಾಟನಿಠರಾಂಗಪಟಾರಲಾನಯಿರನದದರನಾಜಲದರನಾಗಧರನದದಗರ ಪಶಿಯಂಗರರನಗರರಲನಾಜಯಂಗರರಲದರನದ� ಇಪಡಿ ಸಬಗತಾನದರನವರನಾಜಲತಾಂ ಪರಬಹದರನಾಗತ ಇಪಡಿ ಸಬಗತಾನದರನಾಗತ See if you can do a better job of clustering it, and again, we'll go around the room and see how, this is a more complicated problem than what you touch every day, so there'll be different headings for different people. So roughly, eight people. And again, if you have the same answer, you stack them, so if you have the same note, just put them on top of each other. Okay, and we're at 8,000 now. Okay, so Esther's doing really good. Do you have anything you wanna add, Esther? Okay, cool. Hey, maybe one more minute to get your ideas up on the board. Okay. Okay, let's go around the room and we'll see if the teams that are still wrapping up can wrap up. Okay, let's hear what the different groups are doing. It's not vital that you get everything done. Let's start. Tell us all of your categories from left to right. We have some problems here that we can see. I'm nervous. I don't have time to go in. Where were you? Yeah, we also have a lot of problems. Yeah, a lot of problems. I didn't tell you whether there's going to be any issues. No. It's a very vital thing that we're going to have. Not a good reason. Which is, you have, okay. Zoom. Okay. Next one. Alright, so we have weather. Should I just do it all? Yeah, just do it all. I'll clarify. Okay. Weather. So we've got weather. Yeah. Let's just get there. Inconvenience, schedule for safety, especially at night, cost of care, alternatives to going there, and activities that either don't have to be there over the past year. Personal problems, it's just not having a presence there. Yeah, it seems like a common theme. Okay, got it. Next team. Okay. I think, Sam, I think that I would like to support everyone on downtown and the fun things you can do there. But not important things to do is the number one thing. Yeah. As well as, like, distance, and then it comes from that. Like, you have, you don't want to worry about planning for it. There's other things. It's available to you much closer. And then the price, whether it's 60 cents a day. Okay. Okay. So definitely some common themes. Next team. Yeah, we have some pretty similar stuff. Like, not knowing what to do. One of our issues we have here today is we can't drink there. We don't drink wine. We weather CMUs, like, we're in a bubble that we're trapped in. The lagginess of the port authority sometimes. Yeah. My friend's stuff. And we also have noise stuff. Wow, see, the two noise issue ones. It's not a good thing. I've never heard that. I've never thought about how to prove it. Next. Yeah. So, yeah, there are two. Yeah. We work so hard for it. There's a lot of information about what you can have. You can have money. So there's a lot of devices you can have. I think we have a lot of questions about the weather and the ships that we are going to use. Okay. Next team. So we have 20, that's a pretty powerful amount of money on this. We saw our parking, transportation, weather. Okay. Okay. Interesting. Okay. Finally. So we have weather, transportation, lots of crowds, lack of activities, costs, safety, and we also have cell reception. Yeah. Now would that maybe go under safety? Like do we already communicate? Oh yeah. Friends? I don't know. That's a little bit of an oddball one. But yeah. Okay. Next team. So we have a lot of questions about the weather and the ships that we are going to use. Okay. Next team. So we have weather, transportation, lack of activities, costs, safety, and we also have cell reception. Okay. Next team. So we have weather, transportation, lack of activities, costs, safety, and we also have cell reception. Okay. Next team. close it down early, the restaurants are empty by 8. You can't even get food after 8 there. Yeah, we can talk about that. I mean, if you like Walnut Street, then you'll fall in love with them. Burn! Okay, sit back down. We're going to move on. Okay, so just to wrap up a little bit on observation and niche finding, there's two sort of effects that I wanted to briefly mention that can sometimes impair your ability to get a good contextual view. So number one is this notion of expert blindness. How many people have heard the term expert blindness before? It's a really important term. So basically this is this notion that you are so good at what you do that you basically can no longer see the pitfalls. This is sort of like the Snapchat interface effect. You're so good at using it and you're so adept at mobile applications that you can sort of figure it out. But that isn't expert blindness. If you think that's an easy interface to use, it's because you're suffering from expert blindness. So it's very dangerous. Masters who you are trying to learn from will exhibit expert blindness. So they'll skip over. It's like, oh, I'm just going to spool this to the printer. And they'll push like 15 buttons really fast and you'll have no idea what happened. And you may assume, oh, they just went to like file, print, and they hit return or something like that. But actually it might have been this really complicated system where they had to check some box and collate it and double-cite it. So you have to be very cognizant that the master is suffering from expert blindness. And you yourself as like sort of an expert in HCI or UX or computer science, whatever your discipline may be, that you're going to suffer from it in sort of an opposite way. So this is sort of doubly important that when you're in these activities, that you go through the process. Don't just let them demonstrate for you, because things that seem so trivial actually may actually be really complicated. And if you do it yourself, you'll see, oh, hold on, I have to select this like other weird printer, I have to print it in order to get it to like the claims department, just sort of like virtual school box or some really esoteric thing. You'll discover that if you make them do it. That's one of the reasons why it's a master-apprentice model, that you're meant to learn, you're meant to do it. You're going to do it in a very poor, slow way, but it forces you to have to basically kind of learn their job. Again, not just an interview. You want to have that kind of relationship. So tech deployments is a double. So here's this one example. I pulled this out of an old Microsoft video. This is them testing what would become Windows 95, but back in 93. And it's someone using a mouse for the first time. And you might think, oh, that's a really intuitive thing. But it's actually pretty difficult. So let's watch this video. And he's doing a think-aloud. Go. I'm using a double-click mouse. I'm going to icon. I'm coming down here. I'm going to get there. I'm going to be sure that it's on, though. It's on twice. I'm going to click this. I'm going to read down here. Let me read it again to see if I did something wrong. Double-click. Oh, I'm using a double-click. It took me to the left twice. I did that. Yeah, great. You did a good job. Your mouse pointer is jumping between the clicks, so that's why it's not working. Oh. Boy, that's too sensitive. and over here. Pause it there. Okay, so I'll just pause it there. Is, you know, we take for granted using a trackpad and a mouse. And this person's using it really for the first time. And what they notice in that, when they're testing this early, we're like a beta version of Windows 95, is that we have, right now, all of us have this mouse memory where if we double click with the mouse, we know to keep it still. But for someone who hasn't really developed that sort of physical intuition, he was clicking, and in between the click, he was just nudging it. You know, the click was causing the mouse to jump like one or two pixels, you know, a very small amount. And in response, Windows was rejecting it as a double click. It's like clicks have to happen in the same spot. It seems like such a tiny thing, but this person actually couldn't do it. I mean, the video, I'm sure, was longer, and it was probably, he was encountering this problem in many different spots in the interface. So again, it seems so obvious to us, and we can pretty much walk up to any computer with a mouse to track that, and we can use it immediately. And that's because you have tens of thousands of hours of practice on those things that you can basically walk up to like an airport kiosk for getting your ticket, and you can use it immediately, right? Because you're so good at it. And I'm sure you've been next to someone else online, or like the automated checkout at like Giant Eagle, and there's just someone who is just getting destroyed by that interface, and just cannot get to the finish line. And you might be like, oh, they're dumb, but they're not, they're just inexperienced. And you're an expert, and you just don't realize that you're an expert. Here's another interesting item. Sorry, this popped up so many times. I'll turn off the light, it's probably gonna be a popped page. So there's a really interesting little kind of micro-study that they ran. Can anyone, if you look closely at this, can you notice something unusual? So they gave this to radiologists, okay? They gave this to radiologists who are experts at looking at these things, and basically saying, oh, there's like a tumor here, or there's like, I don't know, like a lung cavity, and there's like, you know, some sort of like water in the lungs, or something like that. And I think this is a cross-section of someone's lung. And if you're in the front row, see what really where is it? What is that? It's a little gorilla inside someone's lungs. And what they found, if you stand in the back row, it's very solid, like you can sort of see it. And they showed this to radiologists, like, do you notice anything wrong about this human? It's a healthy human. So they're like, no, the CT scan looks fine. There's a freaking gorilla in there, which is clearly not like fun. We think that's the most obvious thing to talk about if you're an expert. But the fact that they're so tuned to pattern matching for actual medical things, that they're basically blind, cognitively blind, is something that is very remarkable. So for example, expert blindness, novices sometimes can see things more clearly than even experts in some cases. Okay, here's a totally different effect that some of you may be aware of. So if you know the answer to this, sort of mums the word, let other people sort of think it through. But it's another effect that comes up all the time when you're studying the context and the contextual background of problems. So the original, kind of the classic study of this actually goes back to the 40s, to World War II. And what they were looking at is the military was trying to figure out where they could put extra armor. They had a certain payload capacity on the design of bombers, and they could add on a certain amount of extra armor. And what they did is they said, well, let's do this in a data-driven way. Rather than just like, yes, where we should put the armor, let's do this in a data-driven way. And so when we look at lots of aircraft that are coming back from combat situations, we can look at, you know, where they're getting shot, right? And so for the military, look at the bomber, the recurrence of enemy territory, and they recorded where those planes had taken the most damage. And over and over again, they saw the same pattern, right? That bullets tended to accumulate, damage to the aircraft tended to accumulate along the wings, around the tail gunner, and down the center of the bomb. Okay, they saw this pattern, this is where it's accumulating the most damage. So, taking this into account, where would you put the armor if you were the military? Okay. Yeah, so back in the day, these big bombers had like little, kind of like little turrets. So if an enemy fighter was tailing the bomber, they'd have a way to shoot back at the person that was flying on. So he'd tail gun him in a little bubble at the back with his own machine gun. And there was normally a roof underneath and even one in the front on the left of the bigger bomb. Does anyone have a theory on this? Yes? Set that aside for now. Let's just say there's 300 pounds of free weight that we can just add armor onto. Yes? Yes, did everyone hear that? So, the answer is you put the armor where there are no bullet holes. Okay? If you think about this, the planes that are returning, so I have a nice succinct quote here. So here's an example of, for example, an aircraft. So this is not the bomber. So you see, you're getting planes like this returning. You say, oh my gosh, look at the whole wing that's blown off this fighter, little tiny fighter. Right? So you may say, well, where should we make it stronger? And you think, okay, so the first intuition is to put it on the wing, to strengthen up that part that fell off. But the fact is, if this plane lands back at the airfield, it shows you that you can actually lose that part of the wing and still make it back. If you have planes coming where there's no holes, that are the ones where, because it's missing from your data set, it means those are the ones that got shot there and probably just like exploded and they never came back. So the ones that are coming back with holes is where actually it shows you can be shot and survive. Okay? It's a little bit counterintuitive. So let me just say that more simply. The holes actually show where the plane is the strongest, because it can still make it home despite having damage. Okay? And so what you want to do is you want to put the armor everywhere you don't see holes, because that's presumably, assume it's a random distribution of holes, essentially. And so you put armor where you don't see holes. you see no damage because those are the ones that got shot and they come back. Does that make sense? How many people, does this make sense? Okay, good. So, the planes that weren't there are the ones that needed the extra protection, the holes, the sort of thing that you build locations in, these are the least additional ones. So this effect is called survivorship bias. You have to realize that you see survivorship bias in all different things. Because of just natural selection, not just in military aircraft, but in processes and fashion and everything, all you're seeing are the exemplars that survive. So, for example, not the bomb armor, but the notion that older buildings are more beautiful. Pittsburgh has an amazing collection of turn of the century and Gilded Age skyscrapers. But it's actually not true, like all these wonderful Victorians like in Shadyside and stuff. The fact is older buildings are not more beautiful, quantitatively. We have kept, it happened to be that the ones that we decided to preserve and we kept for like a hundred years happened to be the nice ones. That's why we kept them. All the really ugly old buildings, and there were many of them, we've torn them down because they just weren't worth keeping. Same with old cars. People were like, oh my gosh, like a Ford, Thunderbird, like cars back in the 60s were just so elegant and so beautiful and they're still driving. They have like a Jeep from the 50s, it's so reliable. But that's because you're not hearing about like all the cars that were so terrible that it's like trashed them, even in the 60s, they just tossed them out. And there's lots of ones like the Pinto that would just occasionally just explode and kill people, like for no reason. None of those are still driving on the road, even though it's a terrible design. So there's also the notion that they don't make stuff like they used to because someone has some really old tool that happened to be, you know, it's a dishwasher that is still surviving and you bought in the 80s and it still was working. That's because that's an example of something that happened to survive. And you don't have exemplars in the day. Here's some other ones and songs from the 80s. If you watch like Stranger Things, it's always like hit songs. Wow, what an amazing musical era. Because again, if you watch any show or movie set in the 80s, it's like the same collection of 50 really awesome songs from the 80s, and they're not playing all the ranked number 100 song from May of 1982. And if you've never heard of that song, it's not got any kind of nostalgia for you. It's just been essentially lost in time. And same, and I see this a lot. I have a startup myself, and everyone over here can have these crazy best practices. But you have to realize that startups, like the people that got super successful, sort of the Mark Zuckerbergs, for every Mark Zuckerberg, there's probably a thousand other people that had exactly the same idea and failed in different ways. It wasn't just like, he happens to think that his one path was probably like anyone could have done it if he just followed those steps. But there was actually things before Facebook, like Friendster, that were arguably better and run by more adept businessmen, and failed. So you have to take everything with a little bit of a grain of salt. So whenever you're observing people and processes, and even just artifacts, you have to realize that this effect is happening and magnifying certain things. Yep. But they survived for so long, people imagine being in a different company than them, no? Yes. It's correlated, and sometimes they survive just in pure coincidence, like certain movies or cult classics that have survived, or a certain car that, for whatever reason, just accidentally happened to be more stronger than some counterpart. So yes, there normally is a rationale, and I'm sure, Dr. Burton, not to take on poor duck, but I'm sure he wasn't terrible at his job, but I do think that you could probably find other people that were better, and still lost out. So there's lots of examples, like better products that basically were a huge failure, like the Alcoa and Starbreeze era, right? I think so. Like, I understand what's more in terms of pain, because like, oh yes, they survived, but you know that you have to defend them, like men in the home, that didn't. Right. But some, like Dr. Burton's stuff, I don't know what I would put somewhere in that. Or like old cars, too. Like, really, those cars are super great, and people love them, and they're not super safe, but I may like them for a reason, and other parts of the era, you know? Yeah, so.\""
