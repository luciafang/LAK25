      "But we know that it happens whenever\n",
      "there's basically sort of a big event.\n",
      "And measuring, you can take like a multimeter,\n",
      "or even with like an Arduino, you\n",
      "can measure the resistance of the skin pretty easily.\n",
      "And there's even smartwatches that do this now as well.\n",
      "And you'll get this sort of secondary measure\n",
      "of the emotional response of the user.\n",
      "Again, it's hard to know the valence,\n",
      "but you do know the arousal.\n",
      "Likewise, there's a lot of smartwatches\n",
      "that have heart rate now.\n",
      "So heart rate is obviously correlated with many things.\n",
      "Often, if you're sitting still, and your heart rate just\n",
      "goes up.\n",
      "So obviously, if you exercise, you go for a jog,\n",
      "your heart rate goes up, because it's basically\n",
      "trying to move around more oxygen. We all know that.\n",
      "But even if you're just like watching a movie,\n",
      "it's like a scary movie, your heart rate.\n",
      "Yeah?\n",
      "Maybe it's like not everything a person looks at is necessarily something they want to look\n",
      "at.\n",
      "So that's definitely true.\n",
      "And how would that be a problem for systems that use data?\n",
      "Because it's hard to recommend when they want to enter a link versus if they're just\n",
      "looking for it.\n",
      "Yeah, so I mean it's everything you look at, you can't assume is going to be interactive.\n",
      "Like let's say I did have your application where it shows me the competing price on Amazon.\n",
      "So everywhere I look, I'm looking at your shirt, I'm looking at your laptop, the eraser,\n",
      "my letterhead just like adds everywhere.\n",
      "You can get it for $2.99 on Amazon.\n",
      "You know?\n",
      "Like it'd be totally insane.\n",
      "So how do you solve this problem?\n",
      "How do you have it so that it's more explicit?\n",
      "It isn't just constant.\n",
      "Yep?\n",
      "You can have a link where it's like there's a whole lot of screen.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And you're almost like asking for the system to guide you.\n",
      "Yeah, so you do the link?\n",
      "Yeah?\n",
      "Yeah, that's definitely one possible way.\n",
      "What are some other options?\n",
      "How about wearables and stuff like the button or something?\n",
      "Yeah, so you could have some other kind of auxiliary input mechanism.\n",
      "Yeah?\n",
      "with a Google home page experience.\n",
      "This is unintentional, almost pervert,\n",
      "all the way to a very intentional gaze behavior.\n",
      "So people have studied this.\n",
      "And there's a link to the paper if you want to read more.\n",
      "So here are some uses that I put together.\n",
      "It's an automatic scrolling.\n",
      "So you get to the end of the page.\n",
      "And on that, you scroll.\n",
      "So you read on your Kindle, and it goes to the next page.\n",
      "We're going to talk about magic pointing, which\n",
      "is that gaze-assisted kind of Fitts' law thing,\n",
      "where if I'm looking at Chrome, and I'm\n",
      "moving my little triangle towards Chrome,\n",
      "why do I need the triangle?\n",
      "Why can't I just look at Chrome and just say, open,\n",
      "or snap my fingers, or something?\n",
      "And it's a great way to use Fitts' law.\n",
      "And I think it's actually a great way\n",
      "to get rid of the cursor entirely.\n",
      "We already talked about scrolling on something\n",
      "that brings in text and information.\n",
      "Looking at an object and activating it,\n",
      "like saying to it, land on.\n",
      "But again, because I'm looking, it doesn't turn everything on.\n",
      "It isn't that my coffee machine starts making coffee,\n",
      "and my microwave turns on.\n",
      "The only thing I'm looking on turns off.\n",
      "Devices can be in standby while the power machine is looking\n",
      "at them.\n",
      "It doesn't tend to confusion.\n",
      "Virtual agent conversations, having good turn-taking.\n",
      "is you measure the resistance, essentially,\n",
      "or in this case impedance, so AC instead of DC electricity.\n",
      "But you measure the resistance between all pairs, right?\n",
      "You can measure, this pair, this pair, this pair,\n",
      "this pair, this pair, and I can say,\n",
      "I want this pair, this pair, and in the end,\n",
      "you get basically sort of two choose,\n",
      "eight choose two combinations of pathways.\n",
      "And so you get this sort of like mesh of measurements,\n",
      "and then you can actually reconstruct that\n",
      "using something called a radon transform into a 2D image.\n",
      "So that's how they actually get the person's lungs.\n",
      "They can sort of see that one lung has more capacity,\n",
      "or one maybe is filled with liquid,\n",
      "and they're just doing it noninvasively\n",
      "from sensing from the outside.\n",
      "So we took this, this machine cost like half a million\n",
      "dollars, and so I challenged one of my PhD students,\n",
      "I said, can you make an EIT machine that costs like $5,\n",
      "or $50 as a prototype, and they did.\n",
      "So I'll show you this video to give you a sense.\n",
      "Tomo is a hand gesture sensing technology\n",
      "based on electrical impedance.\n",
      "This technique is used in many industrial\n",
